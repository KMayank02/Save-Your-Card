# What is Hacktoberfest?

 Hacktoberfest is an annual month-long event that encourages open-source contributions and celebrates the open-source community. It typically takes place every October and is sponsored by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub. The main goal of Hacktoberfest is to promote collaboration and contribution to open-source projects by motivating developers to make meaningful contributions to GitHub-hosted repositories.

# ðŸš€ Steps To Be Followed

1. **Sign Up**: First, visit the official Hacktoberfest website (https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and sign up for the event. You'll need a GitHub account to participate.

## After registering to hacktoberfest 2023 you can fork this repository by following some steps :

4. **Fork this Repository**: Click the "Fork" button on this project's GitHub page. This creates a copy of the project in your GitHub account.

5. **Clone Your Fork**: Using Git, clone the forked repository to your local development environment. You can do this by running a command like:

```shell
   git clone https://github.com/atanu3000/Save-Your-Card.git
```

6. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your contribution. This keeps your changes separate from the main project. Use a descriptive branch name, such as "fix-bug" or "add-feature."

```shell
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

7. **Make Changes**: Implement the changes or improvements you want to contribute. Follow the project's coding style and guidelines. Make sure your code is well-documented, and if applicable, include test cases.

8. **Commit Your Changes**: After making your changes, commit them to your local branch with a clear and concise commit message.

```shell
   git commit -m "Add a description of your changes"
```

9. **Push to Your Fork**: Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

```shell
   git push origin your-branch-name
```

10. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: On the original project's GitHub page, click the "New Pull Request" button. Select your fork's branch as the source and the original project's branch as the target. Provide a clear and informative PR description explaining your changes.

11. **Wait for Review**: The project maintainers will review your PR. Be patient, as this process may take some time. Be open to feedback and make necessary adjustments based on their comments.

12. **Merge and Celebrate**: Once your PR is approved and merged into the project, congratulations! You've made a contribution to open source. This counts toward your Hacktoberfest participation.

13. **Repeat**: To meet the Hacktoberfest requirement (usually four valid contributions), repeat this process for other open-source projects throughout October.

Remember to follow ethical and responsible contribution practices. Contributions should be meaningful and aligned with the project's goals. Avoid spammy or low-quality contributions just to meet the Hacktoberfest goal. Always respect the maintainers and their project guidelines.
